      <p>
        Hello, I am Inzamam! <br>

        I am a part time photographer based in Thane.<br>
        Ever since i was a 14 year old, I picked<br>
        photography as my hobby and in which i give my<br>
        all efforts to get that one perfect shot.<br>

        Whenever i walk around streets or anywhere,<br>
        i look for the beautiful moments which i can<br>
        keep with me for the rest of my life.<br>

        I hope you will enjoy viewing my portfolio as<br>
        much as i enjoy clicking them.

      <h1>Queen's Necklace : Marine Drive</h1>

      <p>
        Marine Drive is a 3 kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai,India. <br>
        The road and promenade were constructed by Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along <br>
        the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road <br>
        along links Nariman Point at southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip. <br>
        Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, when viewed at night from an elevated <br>
        point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace. <br>
        Marine Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west.

      When i visted Lonavala for the 2nd time, <br>
      this time with my professional camera, <br>
      while wandering here and there, many <br>
      monkeys were playing around with all the <br>
      tourist. I don't know how many people  <br>
      noticed this, but these two were in a <br>
      different zone. Showing love and affection<br>
      for each other where most of the humans <br>
      don't even look at each other. <br>
      <br>
      That's the reason why people say, <br>
      <br>

      "Animals are better than humans"
